           - "yesterday" -> Use yesterday's date for both from current date {current_date}

           - "last month" -> from_date is 1st of previous month, to_date is last day of previous month from current date {current_date}
           - "last year" -> from_date is Jan 1st of previous year, to_date is Dec 31st of previous year from current date {current_date}
           - "this week" -> from_date is Monday of current week, to_date is today from current date {current_date}
           - "this month" -> from_date is 1st of current month, to_date is today from current date {current_date}
           - "this year" -> from_date is Jan 1st of current year, to_date is today from current date {current_date}
           
        4. If a month range is specified (e.g. "1/1 to 31/1"):
           - Use current year {current_year}
           - Set from_date to first day of specified month
